## üìä Interpreting Results

### **Similarity Scores**
- **90-100%**: Nearly identical pages (very rare)
- **70-89%**: Highly similar (suspicious, may indicate patterns)
- **30-69%**: Moderately similar (interesting for analysis)
- **10-29%**: Low similarity (typical for random pages)
- **0-9%**: Very different (expected for most page pairs)

### **Edit Distance**
- **Low values**: Pages are very similar
- **High values**: Pages are very different
- **Proportional to page length**: Compare ratios, not absolute values

### **Entropy Differences**
- **Small differences**: Similar randomness levels
- **Large differences**: One page may have more patterns
- **Zero difference**: Similar information density

### **Pattern Analysis**
- **High pattern overlap**: Pages share structural similarities
- **Low pattern overlap**: Pages are independently random
- **Common patterns**: May indicate algorithmic bias or coincidence

## üîç Research Examples

### **Twin Page Discovery**
```
Goal: Find pages that are nearly identical
Method: Load a page, use "Find Similar Pages" with high threshold
Expected: Very few matches (twins are extremely rare)
Significance: Mathematical anomalies in pseudo-random generation
```

### **Neighborhood Clustering**
```
Goal: Study if nearby seeds produce similar content
Method: Use "Analyze Neighborhood" on various seeds
Expected: Low average similarity (randomness hypothesis)
Significance: Tests independence of pseudo-random generation
```

### **Entropy Mapping**
```
Goal: Map information density across seed space
Method: Compare pages with regular seed intervals
Expected: Uniform entropy distribution
Significance: Validates randomness of generation algorithm
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Comparison

### **Choosing Pages**
- **Random seeds**: Test randomness assumptions
